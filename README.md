# To Do List API - .NET 8

## Description

This project is a RESTful API for managing a "To Do List" built with **.NET 8**. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks and manage them efficiently.

The API uses **JWT** for authentication, **Bcrypt** for password hashing, and is structured following **Clean Architecture** with a **multi-layered** approach. Data is managed via **Entity Framework**, and the API exposes an interactive Swagger interface for documentation.

## Technologies

- **.NET 8**
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** for secure password hashing.
- **Clean Architecture** for a maintainable and scalable design.
- **Multi-layered architecture** (Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers).
- **Entity Framework** for database interaction (SQL Server).
- **Swagger** for interactive API documentation.

## Requirements

- **.NET 8 SDK** or higher installed.
- **SQL Server** or any database compatible with Entity Framework.
- **Postman** or any other API testing tool (optional).
